# Technical Introduction to Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) 

Slides: https://eo4geocourses.github.io/KULeuven_Technical-Introduction-to-SDI/#/

This course introduces the concept of SDIs and explains the rationale behind it. It explains the  different technical and non-technical components of an SDI: data, services, metadata, standards, technology, organisational and institutional aspects (people), etc. and how the technological components work together.The module discusses also what SDI are used for, i.e. what are the objectives of a good functioning SDI.. The components and the benefits of an SDI are illustrated using real world examples. The access to SDIs through geoportals is demonstrated. Learners will visit several geoportals and will learn to browse for data.

Table of content:
* SDI Architecture and SDI components
* Reading and Understanding UML and XML
* SDI Standards
* Metadata and Catalog Services
* Data models and data specifications
* Web Services to Access Spatial Data

Learning outcomes:
* To describe and explain the rationale and concepts of SDIs
* To explain the requirements for building a successful SDI
* To recognise and describe the different components of an SDI
* To explain how these components work together in an SDI
* To explain how geoportals are a user interface to SDIs and their specific functions
* To identify the benefits of an SDI for her/his organisation
* To search and find specific datasets
